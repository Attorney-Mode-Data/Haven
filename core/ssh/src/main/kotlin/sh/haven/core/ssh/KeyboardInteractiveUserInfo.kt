/**
 * Bridges JSch's synchronous [UIKeyboardInteractive] callback (invoked on
 * JSch's internal IO thread during auth) to a suspending
 * [KeyboardInteractivePrompter]. The JSch thread blocks in [runBlocking]
 * until the prompter resumes — which, for a UI-backed prompter, means
 * until the user dismisses the dialog.
 *
 * The decision of what to auto-answer versus what to ask the user lives in
 * [KeyboardInteractiveAnswerer], shared with the sshlib engine; this class is
 * only the JSch adapter.
 *
 * Also implements [UserInfo] because JSch's API requires any interactive
 * callback to come in as a single object that implements both interfaces.
 * We deliberately return nulls / false from the [UserInfo] methods so JSch
 * falls back to the password set via `session.setPassword(...)` for
 * password auth, and cancels prompts we don't handle (host-key acceptance
 * is handled separately by [HostKeyVerifier]).
