     * Send [request], resolving up to [MAX_USER_INTERACTION_ROUNDS] rounds of

     *
     * ★ #487: this used to resolve exactly one round, on the reasoning that a
     * provider asking again after the user had satisfied a prompt was not
     * making progress. That reasoning was wrong. Consecutive prompts are the
     * normal path, and they are *different* prompts: OpenKeychain asks first
     * for permission to talk to this app, then shows its key chooser, then —
     * for an on-card key — asks for the PIN and a tap. Each is one round.
     *
     * Stopping after one turned the second prompt into a failure, and a
     * silent-looking one: a `USER_INTERACTION_REQUIRED` reply carries a
     * PendingIntent and no error extra, so it fell through to [errorFrom],
     * which found nothing to report and produced the bare "the key provider
     * refused the request" with no code behind it. A reporter whose app
     * permission was already granted saw exactly that — the permission round
     * resolved with nothing on screen, and the chooser round was rejected as
     * a refusal before it could be shown.
     *
     * Still bounded, for the original reason: a provider that really is stuck
     * re-prompting must not trap the caller forever. The bound is a count of
     * rounds rather than a "same prompt twice" check, because two rounds
     * legitimately carry equal PendingIntents when the provider reuses one.
     *
     * ★★ The other half of the same bug, and the one that actually made the
     * chooser unreachable: **the request to send next is the one the prompt
     * handed back, not the one we sent.** OpenKeychain attaches our request to
     * the prompt as `EXTRA_DATA` and its key chooser returns it augmented —
     * `originalIntent.putExtra(EXTRA_KEY_ID, …); setResult(RESULT_OK,
     * originalIntent)`, verbatim from `RemoteSelectAuthenticationKeyActivity`.
     * Re-sending our own copy throws the answer away, so the provider finds no
     * key id and redirects to key selection again — forever, had the round
     * limit not stopped it first. Every prompt works this way: the passphrase
     * and security-token dialogs return a `CryptoInputParcel` by the same
     * route.
