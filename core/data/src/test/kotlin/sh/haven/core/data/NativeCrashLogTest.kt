/**
 * #509 and #517 are both native crashes, and both stalled on the same missing
 * evidence: the reporter's log ends at `Fatal signal …` with no backtrace,
 * because Haven captures logcat from inside the process that just died.
 * [NativeCrashLog] recovers the tombstone on the next launch instead.
 *
 * What is worth testing here is the bookkeeping, not the framework call. The
 * system re-reports the same crash on every launch for as long as it keeps it,
 * so the dedup is load-bearing: without it one crash accumulates a copy per app
 * start, and the cap then evicts real history to store duplicates of one event.
